Order up is an app that tracks chefs, the dishes that they make, and the ingredients that are in those dishes.
- Chefs have many dishes
- Dishes belong to a chef
- Dishes have many Ingredients
- Ingredients have many dishes

- Chefs have a name
  - Ex: name: 'Chef Remy'
- Dishes have a name and description
  - Ex: name: 'Pasta Al Dente', description: 'Fresh pasta with your favorite sauce'
- Ingredients should have a name and calories.
  - Ex: name: 'Mozzarella', calories: 78


Two migrations have been made for you. You will need to create migrations for the many to many relationship between ingredients and dishes.
(Note: The plural of dish is dishes. The plural of chef is chefs.)
